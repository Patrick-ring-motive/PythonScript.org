globalThis.RANT = `In the grand tapestry of programming, where the threads of logic and madness intertwine, we find ourselves at a crossroads, embroiled in a saga as old as time itself—or at least as old as 𝗣𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗻's quest for modernity. Here we are, in the year 2024, standing on the shoulders of giants, gazing into the abyss of potential that 𝗣𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗻 holds within its grasp. Yet, we find ourselves shackled, tethered to the ground by the very language that promised to elevate us to new heights.

Enter the walrus operator, a beacon of hope, a symbol of 𝗣𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗻's willingness to embrace the future. But lo! What is this treachery? For in the shadow of this mighty walrus, a void festers, a gaping maw of missed opportunity and despair. Optional chaining and null coalescing, the twin jewels of modern programming languages, remain conspicuously absent from 𝗣𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗻's arsenal. These are not mere syntactic sugar, my friends, but the very essence of elegant, robust, and expressive code.

How can we, the stewards of 𝗣𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗻, stand idly by as our beloved language languishes in the dark ages of verbosity and boilerplate? How many more try-except blocks must we write, how many more if-else labyrinths must we navigate before we are granted the tools to write truly 𝗣𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗻ic code? Are we to be forever cursed, forced to peer over the garden wall at our neighbors, envy in our hearts as they revel in the simplicity and grace afforded by optional chaining and null coalescing?

It is a travesty, a mockery of progress, that here in 2024, 𝗣𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗻 developers must still resort to archaic incantations and verbose rituals to achieve what others accomplish with a mere flick of the wrist. The absence of these features is not just a gap in 𝗣𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗻's feature set; it is a gaping chasm, a black hole that threatens to swallow the very soul of 𝗣𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗻ic elegance.

So, I call upon the 𝗣𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗻 overlords, the guardians of the GIL, the shepherds of syntactic sugar: Hear our cries! Bring forth the dawn of a new era in 𝗣𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗻 development. Grant us optional chaining and null coalescing, that we may write code as it was meant to be written: cleanly, concisely, and with the joy that comes from expressing complex ideas in simple terms.

Until then, we remain adrift, a community divided by the presence of the walrus but haunted by the absence of its brethren. Let us not be content with what 𝗣𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗻 is, but strive for what it could be. In the name of progress, in the spirit of innovation, and for the love of all that is 𝗣𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗻ic, let us rally behind this cause. For a language that does not evolve is doomed to become a footnote in the annals of history, a cautionary tale of what happens when complacency takes root.
