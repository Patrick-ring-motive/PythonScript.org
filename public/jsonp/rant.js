globalThis.RANT = `In the grand tapestry of programming, where the threads of logic and madness intertwine, we find ourselves at a crossroads, embroiled in a saga as old as time itselfâ€”or at least as old as Python's quest for modernity. Here we are, in the year 2024, standing on the shoulders of giants, gazing into the abyss of potential that Python holds within its grasp. Yet, we find ourselves shackled, tethered to the ground by the very language that promised to elevate us to new heights.

Enter the walrus operator, a beacon of hope, a symbol of Python's willingness to embrace the future. But lo! What is this treachery? For in the shadow of this mighty walrus, a void festers, a gaping maw of missed opportunity and despair. Optional chaining and null coalescing, the twin jewels of modern programming languages, remain conspicuously absent from Python's arsenal. These are not mere syntactic sugar, my friends, but the very essence of elegant, robust, and expressive code.

How can we, the stewards of Python, stand idly by as our beloved language languishes in the dark ages of verbosity and boilerplate? How many more try-except blocks must we write, how many more if-else labyrinths must we navigate before we are granted the tools to write truly pythonic code? Are we to be forever cursed, forced to peer over the garden wall at our neighbors, envy in our hearts as they revel in the simplicity and grace afforded by optional chaining and null coalescing?

It is a travesty, a mockery of progress, that here in 2024, Python developers must still resort to archaic incantations and verbose rituals to achieve what others accomplish with a mere flick of the wrist. The absence of these features is not just a gap in Python's feature set; it is a gaping chasm, a black hole that threatens to swallow the very soul of Pythonic elegance.

So, I call upon the Python overlords, the guardians of the GIL, the shepherds of syntactic sugar: Hear our cries! Bring forth the dawn of a new era in Python development. Grant us optional chaining and null coalescing, that we may write code as it was meant to be written: cleanly, concisely, and with the joy that comes from expressing complex ideas in simple terms.

Until then, we remain adrift, a community divided by the presence of the walrus but haunted by the absence of its brethren. Let us not be content with what Python is, but strive for what it could be. In the name of progress, in the spirit of innovation, and for the love of all that is Pythonic, let us rally behind this cause. For a language that does not evolve is doomed to become a footnote in the annals of history, a cautionary tale of what happens when complacency takes root.
